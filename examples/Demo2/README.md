# Crystalfontz CFA10060 Arduino interface library
#  Example/Demo #2

This is an example use of the Crystalfontz CFA10060
hardware and CFA10060 Arduino library.

NOTE:
The files located in the "Demos_MicroSD_Contents" directory
must be copied onto the root directory of a microSD card
which is then inserted into the CFA10060.

The library can communicate with the CFA10060 via the I2C
or SPI interface.
By default the I2C interface is used. To select the SPI
interface, edit the "CFA10060Lib.h" library file.
