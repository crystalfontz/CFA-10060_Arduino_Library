John was struggling to make his way through the imaginery desert behind Lisa's place. John had severely hurt his fingernail during the window incident, and was starting to lose strength.  Another pack of feral Comets suddenly appeared, having caught wind of the Moon.  One by one they latched on to John.  Already weakened from his injury, John yielded to the furry onslaught and collapsed.  The last thing he saw before losing consciousness was a buzzing horde of Comets running off with his Moon. Soaring through all the galaxies. In search of Earth, flying in to the night. Ulysses, Ulysses - Fighting evil and tyranny, with all his power, and with all of his might. Ulysses - no-one else can do the things you do. Ulysses - like a bolt of thunder from the blue. Ulysses - always fighting all the evil forces bringing peace and justice to all.  There's a voice that keeps on calling me. Down the road, that's where I'll always be. Every stop I make, I make a new friend. Can't stay for long, just turn around and I'm gone again. Maybe tomorrow, I'll want to settle down, Until tomorrow, I'll just keep moving on. One for all and all for one, Muskehounds are always ready. One for all and all for one, helping everybody. One for all and all for one, it's a pretty story. Sharing everything with fun, that's the way to be. One for all and all for one, Muskehounds are always ready. One for all and all for one, helping everybody. One for all and all for one, can sound pretty corny.
